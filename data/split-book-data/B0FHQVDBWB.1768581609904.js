Not if I want to live.</i></b></p> <p>The day I watched my mom's pack destroy her, was the day I knew I had to run from the shifter cities.</p> <p>Mom and I share the same designation, which means we'll share the same fate.</p> <p>For ten years I hide from the cities and the alphas who control them.</p> <p>Until my luck runs out.</p> <p>Dragged to Golden Claw against my will, they charge me as a rogue. I'm facing death until one of the strongest alphas in the city scents me as his match.</p> <p>Scents me... and <i>claims</i> me.</p> <p>Even worse? He's part of the most powerful pack of alphas the cities have ever seen.</p> <p>I have to reject them. It's the only way to avoid my mom's curse of fate. And my own.</p> <p>Except, these alphas have never been rejected a day in their lives, and they're definitely not about to start now.</p> <p>* This is a why choose romance with very dominant and possessive male main characters. The female main character will not choose between the love interests. It's a full length (95k words) romantasy and contains adult themes and descriptions that are suitable for 18+. This is part of a series and ends on a cliffhanger. It won't hurt too much, though, I promise. Or maybe you like a little pain with your pleasure. Either way, you'll be just fine.</p>";
