window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A hockey romance performed by a full cast including Samantha Brentmoor, Teddy Hamilton, Jason Clarke and Connor Crais!</p> <p>I swear I only asked one hot hockey-playing friend to give me romance lessons for the week, but three hockey stars volunteered.</p> <p>The post breakup plan was simple escape from my toxic ex to a vacation rental and stay far away from men.</p> <p>But thanks to a booking snafu I'm accidentally sharing it with three hot hockey players. One's flirty, one's broody, one's a cheeky Brit, and they're all the most attentive men I've ever met.</p> <p>After a couple of glasses of champagne, I'm telling them about the contest my ex is running on his dating advice web site. The topic? What makes a great boyfriend, and I want to submit a column.</p> <p>All three offer to show me every single thing I've been missing in and out of bed.</p> <p>We make a deal for one week only. It's only for revenge, of course. I work for the other hockey team in the city so it'd be a big mistake to truly get involved with a rival, let alone three.</p> <p>Even though I melt under their touch. They show me what it means to be adored, cherished and romanced.</p> <p>But as the week ticks on, what started as revenge fast turns into me giving my heart to three men I can't have. Looks like I'm well and truly pucked.</p>";
