That’s what I am.</p> <p>Five times I betrayed the Outfit. With my blood I made a vow to our cause, swore my life to it, promised to put the Outfit first. Above all else. Five times I chose a woman over the good of the Outfit. I betrayed my father. My vow. My men. You reap what you sow. Would my betrayals destroy everything I swore to protect?</p> <p><b>Valentina</b></p> <p>On our wedding day, I made a vow to stand by Dante’s side. In good and in bad times. To love him through it all.</p> <p>Growing up in the mafia, I knew the challenges in our life would be numerous. I never expected them to tear at the very base of our family, of our existence.</p>";
