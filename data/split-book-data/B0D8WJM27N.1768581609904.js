Containing 80 articles written by J.K. Rowling for the original Pottermore website and available for the first time in audio, exclusively from Audible, Harry Potter fans everywhere are in for a treat.</b><br> <br> If there’s one thing Harry Potter fans have in common (apart from impeccably good taste), it’s <i>questions</i>… so many questions. From the simple details that perplex us all – was Professor Umbridge always that awful? Why don’t wizards just use phones? – to the personal details that bring us closer to J.K. Rowling’s writing process – from her least favourite school subject and its impact on Professor Snape’s career, to the personal significance of King’s Cross and why it’s always where the Hogwarts Express departs – this is a veritable treasure trove of <i>answers.<br> <br> </i>Narrated by Evanna Lynch, Hugh Quarshie, Finlay Robertson and Lara Sawalha, and with an exclusive foreword by Evanna Lynch, this spellbinding audiobook is essential listening for any Harry Potter aficionado. <br> <br> The articles in From the Wizarding Archive were originally written by J.K. Rowling for pottermore.com and remain free to read in English on wizardingworld.com. 35 of the 80 articles were originally published across three Pottermore Presents eBooks. This is the first time any of the content has been available in audio format.<br> <br> Theme music composed by Sara Carvalho.</p> <p>Available in Dolby Atmos on Audible.</p>";
