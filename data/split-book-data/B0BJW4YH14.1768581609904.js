But ever since a bargain went awry, he's been a laughing stock. A deal with Mariel could earn back his deadly reputation. However, getting Mariel to sign over her soul is going to be a lot harder than he anticipated. <br> <br> Ozroth can't leave her side until she makes a deal, and becoming awkward roommates quickly escalates into real attraction. But Ozroth is running out of time - and if he succeeds, he'll damn Mariel and their chances at love in the process.<br> <br> ****<br> <br> <b>GLIMMER FALLS SERIES</b><br> 1.
