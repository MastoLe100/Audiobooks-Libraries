window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I've seen every square inch of Violet Eatons delectable body, and she has no idea who I am. Until now. What happened between us online, in our chats, was meant to stay anonymous and in the past. Until it didn't. </p> <p>It's a small world, but Ruby Creek is even smaller. When I move to the tiny town, the grumpy façade I've created slips when we're forced to live under the same roof. Every flush of her cheeks, every time her eyes flare with heat, every time she begs me not to stop, the ice I've encased myself in melts. She has me wanting things I can't want. Things I've been dreaming about since I first laid eyes on her two years ago. Things I don't deserve.</p> <p>But my invisible wounds have the power to ruin us both. As a former soldier, I should have the discipline to walk away, but the more I open up to Violet, the more I want to keep her. I came back from the war a different man, but my scars are older and deeper than anyone knows, and I planned to keep it that way. I planned to keep my secrets hidden. Until her.</p>";
