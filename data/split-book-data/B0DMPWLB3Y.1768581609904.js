The villagers call it The Eating Woods because what's taken is never given back.

The one tasked to keep her hidden from the magehood that seeks to crucify her in the name of an arcane prophecy. Zevander Rydainn, known to his prey as The Scorpion, is the coldest, most calculated assassin in all of Aethyria, and he'd sooner toss his feisty ward to a pack of vicious fyredrakes than keep her safe.</p> <p>If only he could.</p> <p>Maevyth's blood is the key to breaking his despised curse and vanquishing the slumbering evil in Witch Knell.
