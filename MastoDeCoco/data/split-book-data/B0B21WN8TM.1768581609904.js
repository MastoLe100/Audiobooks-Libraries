But waking up from a martini-and-lust-fueled night to find herself married to Caiden Verran, the reclusive billionaire who owns the hotel and most of the city, isn’t the jackpot one would think.

And Caiden is the most dangerous of all—an intoxicating cocktail of sin and raw, insatiable hunger. She should run.
