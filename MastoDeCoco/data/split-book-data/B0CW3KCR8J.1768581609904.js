window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A brand new standalone hate-to-love, brother's best friend hockey romance.</p> <p>My new roommates are two pro hockey players.</p> <p>First, my f-boy of an older brother, and second, his seriously hot best friend (who I seriously hate).</p> <p>This was a last resort. No one should be sleeping on a futon that smells like Cheetos and man sweat. But here I am, trying to get my life together.</p> <p>Tristan Stiles is the bane of my existence. He never wears a shirt. We can’t seem to stop fighting. He’s an arrogant playboy with a filthy reputation. Sure, I had a crush on him when I was fourteen but that was a long time ago. I know better than to trust him. I just need to survive long enough to find a new job and get a new place. And not accidentally let Tristan show me exactly how well-deserved his reputation is.</p>";
