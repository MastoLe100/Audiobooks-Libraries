I wanted a fresh start, to follow a new dream that I had to find after I lost Elijah.</b></p> <p>Moving to New York was the best thing for me. I had it all planned out: new friends, new job, and a new adventure.</p> <p>And a new adventure I had: my best friend's dad. It was supposed to be a taboo fling...but it was so much more. We were tied together by more than a mutual connection.</p> <p>It ran deeper than blood.</p> <p>The thought of starting over again petrified me, but here I am, ready for a new beginning and the new adventure I craved, it just wasn't the one I had planned.</p> <p><i>Dear Heart, you screwed me.</i></p>";
