This steamy, roommates-to-lovers romantic comedy will bring all the laughs while burning up your earbuds at the same time.</p> <p>Did I think I was going to fall for my coach's daughter?</p> <p>The answer would be no. I'm still unclear on how I got into this predicament in the first place. A year ago, I was a man with one thought on his mind, the redhead I met at a hotel bar. Twelve months later, I found her. Unfortunately for me, she not only happens to be my very off-limits coach's daughter, but also . . . my new assistant and roommate. I don't even need an assistant, but Coach Wood doesn’t take no for an answer. Add in him writing up tasks for his daughter, Wylie, to complete for me? Well, it's his own form of sweet torture. We are talking tasks that I would never ask her to do. Tasks that make her despise me. Hate me. That make her utter four words that cause a shiver to crawl up my spine . . . Posey, this is war.</p>";
