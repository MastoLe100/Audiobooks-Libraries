She'd once dreamt of running away with August, eager to escape the misty, remote shores of Saoirse Island and chase new dreams together. Now, she is doing what her teenage self swore she never would: living a quiet existence among this tight-knit community steeped in folklore and tradition, ruled by the seasons and ancient superstitions. <br><br>But when August returns after fourteen years to bury his mother's ashes, Emery must confront her first love and the reason he left so abruptly. But the town wants August gone again. And as the island begins to show signs of strange happenings, the emergence of deep betrayals and hidden promises threatens to reveal the truth behind Lily's death once and for all.<br><br><i>'There were tales that only the island knew. Ones that had never been told. I knew, because I was one of them.'</i><br><br><b><u>Praise for Adrienne Young</u></b><br><br><b>'Spellbinding' Jodi Picoult on <i>Spells for Forgetting</i></b><br><br><b>'Fierce, vivid, and violently beautiful' Stephanie Garber on <i>Sky in the Deep</i></b><br><br><b>'This book broke my heart into a thousand pieces, then put it back together even stronger than before' <i>Kirkus </i>on <i>Sky in the Deep</i></b><br><br><b>'Young has a way with words - they are powerful, raw, and filled with emotion' <i>Indie Next List Review </i>on </b><i><b>The Girl the Sea Gave Back</b></i><br><br>(P) 2022 Penguin Audio";
